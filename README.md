Short text classification in PHP
================================

Algorithms:
- Decision Tree (or Classification Tree) 
- k-Nearest Neighbors  
- Naive Bayes 

We use algorithms for classification messages in On-line Social Networks such as Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus.
The folder /data/ contains examples from real Social Networks and simple stop-words list for tests. The tests cover two aspects: accuracy (performance) and processing time.
